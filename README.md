## Getting Started
This is an implementation of an AI learning to play the popular Mario Bros game.
The AI was trained on $10^6$ frames of the game using simplified moveset (7 moves allowed), the weights and logs are given.
### Installation
All the packages used in the notebook are installed first in the notebook.

If you want to train the model yourself and see how it works, you can monitor the loss graphs using the following command in the log directory :

* Tensorboard
  ```sh
  tensorboard --logdir=. 
  ```
